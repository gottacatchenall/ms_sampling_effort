Viral surveillance is costly but rarely optimized using model-guided prioritization strategies, and predictions from a single model may be highly uncertain. Here, we generate an ensemble of eight network- and trait-based statistical models that predict mammal-virus associations, and we use model predictions to develop a set of priority recommendations for sampling potential bat reservoirs and intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 and related betacoronaviruses. We find over 200 bat species globally could be undetected hosts of betacoronaviruses. Although over a dozen species of Asian horseshoe bats (             Rhinolophus             spp.) are known to harbor SARS-like coronaviruses, we find at least two thirds of betacoronavirus reservoirs in this bat genus might still be undetected. Although identification of other probable mammal reservoirs is likely beyond existing predictive capacity, some of our findings are surprisingly plausible; for example, several civet and pangolin species were highlighted as high-priority species for viral sampling. Our results should not be over-interpreted as novel information about the plausibility or likelihood of SARS-CoV-2's ultimate origin, but rather these predictions could help guide sampling for novel potentially zoonotic viruses; immunological research to characterize key receptors (e.g., ACE2) and identify mechanisms of viral tolerance; and experimental infections to quantify competence of suspected host species.},

This proposition first envisioned by Forbes (1907) and then Diamond (1975) prompted the development of numerous modelling approaches (e.g. null model analysis, co-occurrence networks and, more recently, joint species distribution models). Both theory and experimental evidence support the idea that ecological interactions may affect co-occurrence, but it remains unclear to what extent the signal of interaction can be captured in observational data. It is now time to step back from the statistical developments and critically assess whether co-occurrence data are really a proxy for ecological interactions. In this paper, we present a series of arguments based on probability, sampling, food web and coexistence theories supporting that significant spatial associations between species (or lack thereof) is a poor proxy for ecological interactions. We discuss appropriate interpretations of co-occurrence, along with potential avenues to extract as much information as possible from such data.},

  abstract = {Although microbial communities are ubiquitous in nature, relatively little is known about the structural and functional roles of their constituent organisms' underlying interactions. A common approach to study such questions begins with extracting a network of statistically significant pairwise co-occurrences from a matrix of observed operational taxonomic unit (OTU) abundances across sites. The structure of this network is assumed to encode information about ecological interactions and processes, resistance to perturbation, and the identity of keystone species. However, common methods for identifying these pairwise interactions can contaminate the network with spurious patterns that obscure true ecological signals. Here, we describe this problem in detail and develop a solution that incorporates null models to distinguish ecological signals from statistical noise. We apply these methods to the initial OTU abundance matrix and to the extracted network. We demonstrate this approach by applying it to a large soil microbiome data set and show that many previously reported patterns for these data are statistical artifacts. In contrast, we find the frequency of three-way interactions among microbial OTUs to be highly statistically significant. These results demonstrate the importance of using appropriate null models when studying observational microbiome data, and suggest that extracting and characterizing three-way interactions among OTUs is a promising direction for unraveling the structure and function of microbial ecosystems.},

  abstract = {The structure of ecological interactions is commonly understood through analyses of interaction networks. However, these analyses may be sensitive to sampling biases with respect to both the interactors (the nodes of the network) and interactions (the links between nodes), because the detectability of species and their interactions is highly heterogeneous. These ecological and statistical issues directly affect ecologists' abilities to accurately construct ecological networks. However, statistical biases introduced by sampling are difficult to quantify in the absence of full knowledge of the underlying ecological network's structure. To explore properties of large-scale ecological networks, we developed the software               EcoNetGen               , which constructs and samples networks with predetermined topologies. These networks may represent a wide variety of communities that vary in size and types of ecological interactions. We sampled these networks with different mathematical sampling designs that correspond to methods used in field observations. The observed networks generated by each sampling process were then analyzed with respect to the number of components, size of components and other network metrics. We show that the sampling effort needed to estimate underlying network properties depends strongly both on the sampling design and on the underlying network topology. In particular, networks with random or scale-free modules require more complete sampling to reveal their structure, compared to networks whose modules are nested or bipartite. Overall, modules with nested structure were the easiest to detect, regardless of the sampling design used. Sampling a network starting with any species that had a high degree (e.g., abundant generalist species) was consistently found to be the most accurate strategy to estimate network structure. Because high-degree species tend to be generalists, abundant in natural communities relative to specialists, and connected to each other, sampling by degree may therefore be common but unintentional in empirical sampling of networks. Conversely, sampling according to module (representing different interaction types or taxa) results in a rather complete view of certain modules, but fails to provide a complete picture of the underlying network. To reduce biases introduced by sampling methods, we recommend that these findings be incorporated into field design considerations for projects aiming to characterize large species interaction networks.},

Different techniques have been devised to predict species interactions using theoretical models or abundances. Here, we explore the K nearest neighbour approach, with a special emphasis on recommendation, along with a supervised machine learning technique. Recommenders are algorithms developed for companies like Netflix to predict whether a customer will like a product given the preferences of similar customers. These machine learning techniques are well-suited to study binary ecological interactions since they focus on positive-only data. By removing a prey from a predator, we find that recommenders can guess the missing prey around 50\% of the times on the first try, with up to 881 possibilities. Traits do not improve significantly the results for the K nearest neighbour, although a simple test with a supervised learning approach (random forests) show we can predict interactions with high accuracy using only three traits per species. This result shows that binary interactions can be predicted without regard to the ecological community given only three variables: body mass and two variables for the species' phylogeny. These techniques are complementary, as recommenders can predict interactions in the absence of traits, using only information about other species' interactions, while supervised learning algorithms such as random forests base their predictions on traits only but do not exploit other species' interactions. Further work should focus on developing custom similarity measures specialized for ecology to improve the KNN algorithms and using richer data to capture indirect relationships between species.},

Most of the current methods to infer the existence of interactions between two species require a good knowledge of their behaviour or a direct observation of interactions. In this paper, we overcome these limitations by developing a method, inspired from the niche model of food web structure, using the statistical relationship between predator and prey body size to infer the matrix of potential interactions among a pool of species. The novelty of our approach is to infer, for any species of a given species pool, the three species-specific parameters of the niche model. The method applies to both local and metaweb scales. It allows one to evaluate the feeding interactions of a new species entering the community. We find that this method gives robust predictions of the structure of food webs and that its efficiency is increased when the strength of the body\textendash size relationship between predators and preys increases. We finally illustrate the potential of the method to infer the metaweb structure of pelagic fishes of the Mediterranean sea under different global change scenarios.},

However, when only partial samples are available, quantifying the overlap between two sets becomes an estimation problem. Furthermore, to calculate normalized measures of {$\beta$}-diversity, such as the Jaccard and Sorenson-Dice indices, one must also estimate the total sizes of the sets being compared. Previous efforts to address these problems have assumed knowledge of total population sizes and then used Bayesian methods to produce unbiased estimates with quantified uncertainty. Here, we address populations of unknown size and show that this produces systematically better estimates--both in terms of central estimates and quantification of uncertainty in those estimates. We further show how to use species count data to refine estimates of population size in a Bayesian joint model of populations and overlap.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {A critical and poorly understood aspect of food-web theory concerns the possibility that variable observation effort, such as widely different sampling intensities among investigators, confounds structural food-web patterns. We evaluated this possibility by simulating the effects of variable observation effort on the structure of a food web including 77 insect species found inside the stems of 10 species of grasses. A highly detailed description of the trophic structure of this community was provided by an exhaustive sampling program involving dissection of 164 215 grass stems over 12 yr. Most significantly, the data describe the frequency at which each of the consumers and their 126 different trophic links were observed. During the simulated increase in sampling, consistent trends were observed among trophic-species webs as the species richness of these webs increased to a maximum of 73 trophic species. Connectance remained surprisingly constant, while the fractions of top and basal species decreased, and the fraction of intermediate species increased. These trends were much less consistent among taxonomic-species webs. This suggests that comparative analyses of connectance among trophic-species webs constructed with varying degrees of moderate observation effort are generally robust. In contrast, the fractions of species appear to require corrections for variable sample sizes for such analyses. These corrections may be easier to develop for trophic-species webs because of their relatively simple changes with sampling effort.},

  abstract = {Community ecology is tasked with the considerable challenge of predicting the structure, and properties, of emerging ecosystems. It requires the ability to understand how and why species interact, as this will allow the development of mechanism-based predictive models, and as such to better characterize how ecological mechanisms act locally on the existence of inter-specific interactions. Here we argue that the current conceptualization of species interaction networks is ill-suited for this task. Instead, we propose that future research must start to account for the intrinsic variability of species interactions, then scale up from here onto complex networks. This can be accomplished simply by recognizing that there exists intra-specific variability, in traits or properties related to the establishment of species interactions. By shifting the scale towards population-based processes, we show that this new approach will improve our predictive ability and mechanistic understanding of how species interact over large spatial or temporal scales. Synthesis Although species interactions are the backbone of ecological communities, we have little insights on how (and why) they vary through space and time. In this article, we build on existing empirical literature to show that the same species may happen to interact in different ways when their local abundances vary, their trait distribution changes, or when the environment affects either of these factors. We discuss how these findings can be integrated in existing frameworks for the analysis and simulation of species interactions.},

  abstract = {Summary There is a growing realization among community ecologists that interactions between species vary across space and time and that this variation needs to be quantified. Our current numerical framework to analyse the structure of species interactions, based on graph-theoretical approaches, usually do not consider the variability of interactions. As this variability has been show to hold valuable ecological information, there is a need to adapt the current measures of network structure so that they can exploit it. We present analytical expressions of key measures of network structured, adapted so that they account for the variability of ecological interactions. We do so by modelling each interaction as a Bernoulli event; using basic calculus allows expressing the expected value, and when mathematically tractable, its variance. When applied to non-probabilistic data, the measures we present give the same results as their non-probabilistic formulations, meaning that they can be generally applied. We present three case studies that highlight how these measures can be used, in re-analysing data that experimentally measured the variability of interactions, to alleviate the computational demands of permutation-based approaches, and to use the frequency at which interactions are observed over several locations to infer the structure of local networks. We provide a free and open-source implementation of these measures. We discuss how both sampling and data representation of ecological networks can be adapted to allow the application of a fully probabilistic numerical network approach.},

This paper reviews lessons learned from the application of four key technological monitoring solutions (satellite-based remote sensing, cameras, acoustic recording devices and environmental DNA) to identify factors affecting their relevance and applicability. Most tools, if relevant to local user needs and integrated into goal-based monitoring schemes, can contribute to creating the enabling conditions necessary for effective biodiversity monitoring, improving data availability and quality for various taxa when compared with traditional observer-based methods. However, until the tools become cheap enough and easy enough for widespread use (especially in biodiversity-rich countries), and until they can be more inclusive in their taxonomic coverage, technological solutions will still need to be complemented with traditional observer-based methods for the foreseeable future.},

Interactions intrinsically vary across space and time, and given the number of species that compose ecological communities, it can be tough to distinguish between a true negative (where two species never interact) from a false negative (where two species have not been observed interacting even though they actually do). Assessing the likelihood of interactions between species is an imperative for several fields of ecology. This means that to predict interactions between species\textemdash and to describe the structure, variation, and change of the ecological networks they form\textemdash we need to rely on modeling tools. Here we provide a proof-of-concept, where we show a simple neural-network model makes accurate predictions about species interactions given limited data. We then assess the challenges and opportunities associated with improving interaction predictions, and provide a conceptual roadmap forward toward predictive models of ecological networks that is explicitly spatial and temporal. We conclude with a brief primer on the relevant methods and tools needed to start building these models, which we hope will guide this research program forward.},

Hubbell2 generalized this neutral theory to explore the expected steady-state distribution of relative species abundance (RSA) in the local community under restricted immigration. Here we present a theoretical framework for the unified neutral theory of biodiversity2 and an analytical solution for the distribution of the RSA both in the metacommunity (Fisher's log series) and in the local community, where there are fewer rare species. Rare species are more extinction-prone, and once they go locally extinct, they take longer to re-immigrate than do common species. Contrary to recent assertions3, we show that the analytical solution provides a better fit, with fewer free parameters, to the RSA distribution of tree species on Barro Colorado Island, Panama4, than the lognormal distribution5,6.},

They used species accumulation curves to standardize samples among sites, to predict the species richness of sites and to estimate the minimum effort required for adequate completeness of inventories. 2 I argue that their measure of sampling effort, number of nights, is inappropriate because it does not distinguish between genuine differences in species richness among sites and differences in trap efficiency. The number of individuals is the best measure of sampling effort to avoid this problem, as illustrated by data on moths collected from a Bornean rainforest. Furthermore, the approach of Moreno \& Halffter requires the species accumulation curves to be approaching an asymptote for accurate estimation, and so for practical reasons is probably limited to less diverse taxa.},

  abstract = {Aim Predicting the spatial distribution of species assemblages remains an important challenge in biogeography. Recently, it has been proposed to extend correlative species distribution models (SDMs) by taking into account (a) covariance between species occurrences in so-called joint species distribution models (JSDMs) and (b) ecological assembly rules within the SESAM (spatially explicit species assemblage modelling) framework. Yet, little guidance exists on how these approaches could be combined. We, thus, aim to compare the accuracy of assemblage predictions derived from stacked and from joint SDMs. Location Switzerland. Taxon Birds, tree species. Methods Based on two monitoring schemes (national forest inventory and Swiss breeding bird atlas), we built SDMs and JSDMs for tree species (at 100 m resolution) and forest birds (at 1 km resolution). We tested accuracy of species assemblage and richness predictions on holdout data using different stacking procedures and ecological assembly rules. Results Despite minor differences, results were consistent between birds and tree species. Cross-validated species-level model performance was generally higher in SDMs than JSDMs. Differences in species richness and assemblage predictions were larger between stacking procedures and ecological assembly rules than between stacked SDMs and JSDMs. On average, predictions were slightly better for stacked SDMs compared to JSDMs, probabilistic stacks outperformed binary stacks, and ecological assembly rules yielded best predictions. Main conclusions When predicting the composition of species assemblages, the choice of stacking procedure and ecological assembly rule seems more decisive than differences in underlying model type (SDM vs. JSDM). JSDMs do not seem to improve community predictions compared to SDMs or improve predictions for rare species. Still, JSDMs may provide additional insights into community assembly and may help deriving hypotheses about prevailing biotic interactions in the system. We provide simple rules of thumb for choosing appropriate modelling pathways. Future studies should test these preliminary guidelines for other taxa and biogeographical realms as well as for other JSDM algorithms.},
